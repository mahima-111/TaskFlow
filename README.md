* This is  a to do list i created using html, css and javascript.
* I used local storage to store the list items so they wont disappear when u refresh.
* It features an edit button by which we can edit our to-do's, a delete button to delete our to-do's.
* We can also mark our to do item as done by clicking on checkbox.
